The Economic Impact of Hurricane Katrina
Welcome to the repository for "The Economic Impact of Hurricane Katrina." This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the financial impact and long-term economic effects of Hurricane Katrina, focusing primarily on the New Orleans region.

Abstract:

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial impact and long-term economic effects of Hurricane Katrina, with a particular focus on the New Orleans region. Utilizing regression analysis, the study examines pre-disaster housing market dynamics, including mortgage prevalence and property values, and delves into the post-disaster consequences, such as the effects of flooding on insurance claims, property values, and housing stock. Key findings reveal that greater flooding correlated with significant reductions in total debt, mainly due to the use of insurance payouts for mortgage repayment rather than rebuilding, particularly in areas where reconstruction costs exceeded pre-Katrina home values. The study also uncovers socioeconomic disparities in flood impact and the differential effects on housing markets. In terms of long-term economic impact, the research finds considerable, lasting effects on residential locations, but only minimal and transient impacts on employment and income. Remarkably, within a few years, the incomes of Katrina victims surpassed those in similar unaffected cities, indicating a strong economic recovery. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the economic aftermath of natural disasters, highlighting the need for targeted policies and disaster preparedness strategies.
