Title: **SQL and R-Enhanced Credit Risk Analysis**

Objective:

This project is dedicated to creating a sophisticated SQL database system, with an emphasis on meticulous management and analysis of an extensive loan and credit dataset. The primary goal is to harness the power of advanced SQL queries and data analysis techniques, subsequently bridging these with R for further analysis and visualization. This endeavor seeks to evaluate credit risk, offering critical insights into the creditworthiness of individuals.

Key Goals:

1. Data Integration and Management:
   - Develop a robust SQL database, accurately reflecting the nuances of credit data.
   - Seamlessly import and integrate data from Kaggle into the SQL database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Conduct extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to guarantee analysis reliability. Focus areas include resolving missing values, outliers, and inaccuracies.

3. Database Schema Design:
   - Construct an efficient, scalable database schema with optimal indexing, relationships, and constraints, enhancing the support for complex queries and analyses.

4. Advanced SQL Querying:
   - Exhibit SQL mastery through sophisticated queries for data manipulation and retrieval, including complex joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregate functions.

5. Credit Risk Analysis with SQL and R:
   - Analyze critical factors (loan amounts, payment history, income levels, etc.) to assess credit risk.
   - Develop SQL queries and R scripts to identify patterns and trends indicating credit risk levels.

6. Insightful Reporting and Visualization:
   - Generate comprehensive reports and visualizations that offer in-depth insights into credit risk factors, enabling informed decision-making.

7. Documentation and Best Practices:
   - Maintain detailed documentation of database design, data flow, and query logic for clarity and accessibility.
   - Adhere to SQL development and database management best practices.

8. Professional Presentation on GitHub:
   - Present the project on GitHub in a well-structured repository, inclusive of a thorough README, clear code comments, and query output examples.

Purpose:

This project aims to demonstrate a profound understanding of SQL database management and data analysis, paired with R's analytical and visualization capabilities. It's particularly focused on deriving actionable insights from complex datasets in the realm of credit risk assessment, making it a valuable addition to any professional portfolio in the field of data analysis and credit risk management.

Dataset

Overview
This project uses a comprehensive credit risk analysis dataset, primarily focusing on loan and credit information. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle: Credit Risk Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rameshmehta/credit-risk-analysis?resource=download).

Data Sample
In this repository, you will find a representative sample of the dataset. This sample has been carefully selected to demonstrate the core functionalities of our SQL and R-based analysis while adhering to GitHub's file size constraints.

Accessing the Full Dataset
For a more in-depth analysis or replication of the study, the full dataset can be downloaded directly from Kaggle. You can access it using the following link: [Full Credit Risk Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rameshmehta/credit-risk-analysis?resource=download). Please note that you might need to create a Kaggle account to download the dataset.

Data Preparation and Challenges
During the initial stages of this project, I encountered specific challenges related to importing the data into SQL. The primary issues were with the `desc` and `emp_title` columns. These columns contained extensive textual data, making the import process cumbersome and causing compatibility issues with our SQL setup. To streamline the data import process and focus our analysis on the most impactful columns, I decided to exclude these two columns from our analysis. This decision allowed for a more efficient data import and a cleaner, more focused dataset for our analysis.
