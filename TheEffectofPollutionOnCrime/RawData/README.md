Raw Data

Welcome to the Raw Data folder. This folder is intended to store and provide access to the raw data used in our analyses. However, due to the large size of the raw data file, we are hosting it externally.

Accessing the Raw Data

The raw data file is too large to be hosted directly on GitHub. Instead, it is available for download via the following link:
